Welcome to your new dbt project!

# Seed data
Seed data is manually created to support the test cases.

dbt seed

Seeds are overwritten when changed

## iban
For generating realistic iban numbers, a public generator is used:
http://www.randomiban.com/?country=Netherlands

_This is fully random and doesn't contain a reference to real accounts; where by chance it is an existing account this is not intentional._

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
